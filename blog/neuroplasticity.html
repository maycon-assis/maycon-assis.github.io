        Neuroplasticity:
      </h2>
      <p>
        As humans, I believe it's extremely important to know what we can and can't control as individuals. It can
        definitely be the driving factor
        as to if we are able to achieve something or not. This is where Neuroplasticity comes in. When we as individuals
        fully grasp the idea that
        our mind is not fixed but rather in constant development and change throughout are lives, that's when I believe
        we have the ability to thrive.
        It's also something we can influence by determining our learning enviroments, learning
        habbits, thoughts and mindset. Since
        our actions are directly connected to our mindset and thoughts, it will create an impact on our ability to
        physically "do" aswell. We must recognise
        one of our main strengths as human beings, which is our ability to adapt to new stimuli. Our brain is no
        different. Neuroplasticity also refers to
        actual physical changes in the connections between neurons. If we create a demand by approaching new challenges
        and activities wether they
        may be physical or mental, our brain essentially adjusts it's chemical and physical structure to accommodate to
        this new stimulus. Of course, with repetition these newly built pathways
        will strengthen and become more efficient. Understanding this will dramatically change how we deal with learning
        road blocks and contributes to
        the amount of limits we may place on our learning. A lot of the times this is all subconcious. We need to
        exercise our brain.
        But how? Approach and embrace new activities and commit to them frequently as repetition is a crucial part of
        the process.
        With new and repeated experiences that challenge us we can create short term and long term beneficial changes.

      <h2>
        Growth Mindset and my learning plan:
      </h2>
      <p>
        Simply, growth mindset refers to the mindset of believing that your abilities and and talents can be developed.
        In simpler terms, the believe that you
        who is not good at a certain thing, can become good over a period of time with the adequate learning enviroment
        and process. Sometimes
        we may have this mindset when approaching certain things but when it comes to other things we lack it. Since our
        mind and thoughts directly
        impact our actions which dictate our habbits, It is extremely important to have a growth mindset towards
        anything in
        life. I had already heard about about growth mindset but during this exploration I was reminded of how important
        it is and how I need to make more of a conscious effort to approach challenges and new endeavors with it. I feel
        like the hardest part is maintaining the growth mindset throughout a period of time. We should always be
        learning
        so therefore we should always keep this growth mindset. During this course I have tried to practise patience.
        Ultimately,
        good things come with time. With daily mindfulness exercises I'm sure the growth mindset will become more and
        more
        built-in. Also I believe that providing the right amount of effort and hard work goes hand and hand with growth
        mindset.
        Growth mindset should create a drive inside of you to develop your abilities through hard work and perseverance.
        They
        should all live in harmony. Here's a quote a like to live by: “Watch your thoughts, they become your words;
        watch your words, they become your
        actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your
        character, it becomes your destiny.”
