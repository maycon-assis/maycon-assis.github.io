      <h2>
        What is Emotional Intelligence?
      </h2>
      <p>
        EQ or Emotional Intelligence is a person's ability to recognize and understand his own emotions,
        aswell as the emotions of others. This also includes how the person controls and expresses their own
        emotions.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How is EQ different to IQ?
      </h2>
      <p>
        As the name implies, Emotional Intelligence or EQ, refers to how a person views and interacts
        with their emotions and the emotions of others. On the other hand, IQ is referencing one's intellectual or
        cognitive ability which has
        more to do with their logical reasoning, ability to apply knowledge, problem solving, memory etc. These sort of
        Things.
        Generally speaking, one can't alter their IQ while their EQ can very much be trained and developed.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why is EQ important?
      </h2>
      <p>
        EQ is important because as human beings, we can't ignore our emotions and how much they influence
        our day to day lives. Emotions are present in almost everything we do so it is important to be aware of them.
        As well as be competent in controlling and expressing them. This will have a direct impact in how well we are
        able to work, learn, train, have good
        relationships, interact with others etc. Pretty much in all aspects of life.
