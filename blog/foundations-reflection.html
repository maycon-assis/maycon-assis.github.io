      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would say, how impatient I can be at times with my own learning. At times I feel frustrated because I'm
        struggling to understand something straight away. Also how inconsistent my mindset can be.
        This is probably partially because when it comes to learning, I feel very confident that I'm capable of
        learning anything with the right approach, I just haven't quite fully understood that learning takes time
        and sometimes things don't run as smoothly as you planned. even if I give it my best effort, at times I'm just
        going to need longer to absorb or understand something, and that's okay. I can't let it discourage me.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Well, they dictate how well you work with yourself and others. How you treat yourself and others which is
        extremely important in learning and programming. Even in the rare case that you are working or learning
        completely alone, your values, empathy and self-awareness will definitely have in an impact on your mindset and
        thinking towards any task at hand.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Probably just how much emphasis is placed on it. Before starting foundations, I definitely wasn't expecting to
        spend
        as much time as I did on core learning.
        Also, how much thinking I had to do to really assess my personal situation in regards to these core concepts and
        just how
        difficult it was at times to put it into words.
        I've also learned to value good mindset and place it as the most important asset to have when trying to learn.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Taking the time to really deep dive and think about certain topics that I don't usually give the light of day
        to. I've heard
        of most of these concepts but I have never really stopped to think about them and isolate them. Also, I would
        say
        it's challenging
        to visualize how you can convert these concepts into practical habbits that directly benefit your life.
        Personally, I've always struggled with this type of content.

      </p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
        development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would say because Dev Academy believes core learning is crucial when it comes to developing competent and well
        rounded web
        developers. I would agree in a overall sense.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
        time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        To be honest, at times it did feel that way with the amount of content. Maybe it's just something I'm
        not used to.
        Definitely not all of it though because I believe it's important to be aware of these concepts and also
        self-aware
        about personal habbits
        when it comes to them. I believe this is the path to becoming well rounded. However, I did stop a few times and
        think "Do I really need
        to be thinking and
        researching this much about some of this stuff?". It did get a little tedious for me at times.
