      <h2>
        Blocked on a simple problem:
      </h2>
      <p>
        This has happpened a few times lately while learning and using Javascript. I would say a memorable time was
        definitely while working on the gradebook challenge in this sprint.
        The problem was basically that I had to make an object and fill it with the values of two already existing
        arrays. I tried to pseudocode but I couldn't
        wrap my head around the logic behind the problem. I found myself using console.log a lot through trial and error
        and
        just hoping to strike a right answer. It was
        extremely frustrating because I thought I finally had a decent understanding of objects, loops and arrays. I
        spent way too long on a specific problem and I had found myself
        having to take many breaks to keep my mind fresh. I turned to videos and articles to basically reset my
        understanding of objects, loops and arrays. I also asked my peers and facilitators for help through discord.
        I didn't want to get the straight up answer but some advice and direction to approach the problem. I did find
        the guidance I was looking for. I was also sent a video on bracket notation which really made it all click for
        me.
        I would say I learned the importance of using all the available resources around me to better my knowledge.
        Also it can be important to look back at the foundation of a concept when I'm stuck because it can open my mind
        to how I may use this concept.

      <h2>
        Elegantly solved a problem:
      </h2>
      <p>
        I experienced this when I was working the fizzbuzz problem. I had to create a function to check wether a number
        parameter
        was divisble by 3 seperate numbers. Depending on the which number the parameter was divisble by, it would return
        a unique word. I primarily used pseudocode to visualize my initial approach to the problem. Based on the
        knowledge I had,
        I already had a plan on how I thought the problem would be solved. When I started to actually code I felt that
        it flowed really well
        and I was really thinking of how I could solve it efficiently. I knew I had to use the remainder operator
        because I had used it
        before on a similar problem. I used console.log a few times through the code to check if everything was
        working. I ended up
        solving it relatively quickly and it felt great and satisfying. I learned that it's important to try to remember
        past problems
        where you used a similar logic. It really does help the new problem make sense and it makes feel me more
        confident
        solving it.
        I also learned to take some time before coding to try to establish some sort of an approach and to try and
        visualize the problem
        in seperate sections.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Pseudocode:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I need to make this more of a habit. a lot of the time these just stay in my thoughts or I instantly just start
        coding.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Trying something:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is probably my bread and butter. My first response to most problems is to give it a try using just my
        initial thought process.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Rubber ducky method:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I use it occasionally when I really want to hammer down a concept and test how well I really understand
        something.
        While coding I use it when I'm stuck and need to visualize each line of code.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reading error messages:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This has proven to be really helpful. Whenever there is an error message I immediately check what line the error
        is present on.
        This always helps fix any syntax errors.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Console.logging:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This has pratically become second nature by now. Every time I've needed to check wether something is working
        I've used console.log . It's been an essential part of my learning process and programming.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Googling:
      </h3>
      <p>
        If I've forgotten some syntax, need to remember a concept or structure, I'm turning to google. Many websites
        have been really helpful
        at providing useful information on a number of topics. I'm very accustomed to using google to better my
        understanding and seek guidance.

      </p>
      <h3>
        Asking your peers for help:
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm definitely no stranger to sharing on the discord group. I know there is a lot of people trying to solve the
        same problems
        as I am solving so I like to see their approach, open my mind and check if I'm on the right track
      </p>
      <h3>
        Asking coaches for help:
      </h3>
      <p>
        The facilitators are great. They are usually the first to reply to my call for help haha on the group chat. They
        are also very quick to reply and
        know exactly how to challenge us regarding setting us up to approach a problem. I'm very confident with asking
        for their advice and help when
        I feel I need to.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Improving your process with reflection:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Each week this gets easier with all the reflections. I feel like now it's becoming more natural to reflect on
        situations and I'm not having
        to think about it as much.
      </p>
