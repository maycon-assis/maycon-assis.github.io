        Learning Plan: Bootcamp
      </h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal hasn't changed at all and it's still to eventually acquire the necessary skills and abilities
        to become a competent Web Developer. The current destination I have in mind is to secure a good job in the field
        and
        continue to learn and develop my professional skills. Later on in this journey, I hope to potentially branch off
        into other fields in the tech industry aswell and develop my own personal projects to be able to directly
        impact and benefit the community around me and society as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think my ability to remain disciplined when it comes to doing work
        and learning will carry over and benefit me during Bootcamp especially considering the workload. This course
        will continue to be my main prioritiy throughout Bootcamp . When it comes to the limitations, considering the
        increased workload, my impatient at times is something I'll need to keep an eye on throughout Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would saying maintaining a positive and growth mindset for as much of Bootcamp as possible. Maintaining this
        mindest consistently has always been a challenge for me. Especially since it's nine weeks of trying to grasp a
        lot
        of information, concepts and technical material. I've never been comfortable speaking in front of large groups
        of people so I've tried to avoid it when I can. However, if this comes into play during Bootcamp, I do want to
        take
        the opportunity to develop this skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I mentioned above, I really want to use this opportunity to develop my communication and articulation skills.
        Not
        just for my professional career but also for any endeavor in life. In the other side of the spectrum, I want to
        improve
        my ability to listen to others to be able to fully absorb what they are saying. Since there will be a lot of
        collaborative work, I
        would also like to take the chance to develop my teamwork and leadership skills. I'm involved in a few teams and
        groups
        outside of Dev Academy so it would be extremely beneficial for me to better these skills. Without question, I
        hope to
        develop good habits throughout Bootcamp that I can carry on with for the rest of my life. That I may be more
        patient
        with my learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        BasicaIly, I expect the same from the Bootcamp team as I did from the foundations team. But now, it's in person
        so
        it will be a lot more convenient to ask and receive support.
        I know things are about to get crazy and intense so the support will be even more essential. Kindness and
        honesty should always be a staple! Same as in foundations, If i'm swerving off track or struggling to make
        progress
        I expect to be held accountable and guided to the right path.I want the team to be straight up with me when
        necessary and as
        truthful as possible. I'm there to learn. Good vibes as always and friendly relationships with the team will be
        very
        important
        to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am extremely eager and excited to learn as much as possible during Bootcamp! I know my effort, organisation
        and
        motivation will dictate my success for these next nine weeks. As I will be working in an in person environment I
        can make almost
        immediate
        contact with other learners and facilitators, there is definitely no excuse for not seeking help when needed.
        Through foundations
        I frequently requested help from my peers and even more often, my homegroup facilitator. I will definitely
        continue to do this when I feel
        my own personal thinking and resources just can't get the job done. Most likely even more so now because of the
        increased
        workload. This will continue to be done in the most respectful way possible. This Bootcamp will be my main
        prioritiy
        so if I need to work overtime in my own time or in the weekends to get work done or simply develop a better
        understanding, I'm fully prepared to. I want programming to become second nature so the extra frequency will
        definitely help. During Bootcamp
        hours I will stay on top of all the allocated work and remain on schedule. During after hours and weekends I
        still
        want to
        at least do some programming. Also, I will ensure I'm keeping a healthy body and mind throughout Bootcamp. It's
        not
        going to be easy but
        I'm up for the challenge!
      <h2>
        Learning Plan: Foundations
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would say my current long term goal is to eventually acquire the necessary skills and abilities
        to be a competent Web Developer. With these skills I hope to secure a good job in the field and
        develop from there. I would also like to potentially branch off into other fields in the tech industry
        and be capable enough to use what I learned in DevAcademy to develop my own projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        some of strengths when it comes to learning is my ability to remain disciplined when it comes to doing work
        and learning. This course has been one of my main priorities and I want it to remain that way. This
        helps me give my best effort even when i'm frustrated. When it comes to limitations, I would say I do have the
        tendency to feel overwhelmed at times with new content especially when it's more complex stuff. When this
        I might see just a big mountain a have to climb and not focus on the each step it requires to get there. Breaks
        and good planning usually helps mitigate this but during this course I really hope improve at it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would really like to leave this course "thinking like a programmer". To ultimately retune
        the way I think and how I visualize and solve problems. I believe this will also translate
        to many other aspects of life aswell. Another core skill I would like see developed is my
        ability to communicate with others. I want to be able to artigulate plans, ideas, intructions etc
        In an effective way but also in a simple manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working with learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives I will manage myself
        by giving my 100%. I also understand the importance of creating good relationships which is something
        I plan on doing for sure. Of course being respectful and kind at all times! When things are building up
        and starting to get to me I will definitely revisit my motives for being at DevAcademy which should
        help my mindset and keep me on track. If it's something technical or something to do with the work,
        I will definitely seek help and advice wether that's with a fellow learner or a facilitator which
        might be helpful depending on the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will seek help by reaching out to the facilitators, fellow learners/friends and also in the resources we are
        provided with such
        as discord because other learners might be having similar issues. Of course first I will make sure I have
        tried to figure it out for myself first and given it out. If I notice that i'm not getting,
        then I will seek help with the facilitators.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I expect from the Facilitation team is their support through out this course. It's a very full course
        so their support is essential. Kindness and honesty also go a long way. If i'm swerving off track
        or am doing wrong, I expect to be held accountable. Just a good vibe and relationship will very important
        to me. Also friendships to also go beyond the course would be nice aswell.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main working schedule for foundations has been running from 9-5 which has been effective for me
        so I plan on keeping at it. All of my plans are made outside of these hours that have beeen designated for
        DevAcademy work. I know that at times I will need to work outside these hours aswell and my schedule is
        flexible to accommodate to this.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Wellbeing: Bootcamp
      </h2>
      <p>
        My plan for maintaining Wellbeing is essentially to take care of my mind, body and soul throughout the intense
        phases
        of the Bootcamp. Everyday I plan to set a side a time/activity for the upkeep of these three pillars.
        For the
        body, I will
        be doing some sort of exercise as I have always done. For the soul, I tend to pray as I am religious and it is a
        firm value
        that I carry with me. Finally, I will make sure to rest my mind just as I do with my body, aswell
        as keeping
        away from general negativity while always promoting a growth mindset. Ensuring these three needs are met will be
        vital to determining how well I conduct myself throughout this experience. I would also like to get
        adequate rest every
        night
        and give my body and mind the fuel it needs with proper nutrition. Ultimately, I want to have high standards,
        but I also want to ensure that I'm always being kind and positive to myself.
