        Learning Plan
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would say my current long term goal is to eventually acquire the necessary skills and abilities
        to be a competent Web Developer. With these skills I hope to secure a good job in the field and
        develop from there. I would also like to potentially branch off into other fields in the tech industry
        and be capable enough to use what I learned in DevAcademy to develop my own projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        some of strengths when it comes to learning is my ability to remain disciplined when it comes to doing work
        and learning. This course has been one of my main priorities and I want it to remain that way. This
        helps me give my best effort even when i'm frustrated. When it comes to limitations, I would say I do have the
        tendency to feel overwhelmed at times with new content especially when it's more complex stuff. When this
        I might see just a big mountain a have to climb and not focus on the each step it requires to get there. Breaks
        and good planning usually helps mitigate this but during this course I really hope improve at it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would really like to leave this course "thinking like a programmer". To ultimately retune
        the way I think and how I visualize and solve problems. I believe this will also translate
        to many other aspects of life aswell. Another core skill I would like see developed is my
        ability to communicate with others. I want to be able to artigulate plans, ideas, intructions etc
        In an effective way but also in a simple manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working with learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives I will manage myself
        by giving my 100%. I also understand the importance of creating good relationships which is something
        I plan on doing for sure. Of course being respectful and kind at all times! When things are building up
        and starting to get to me I will definitely revisit my motives for being at DevAcademy which should
        help my mindset and keep me on track. If it's something technical or something to do with the work,
        I will definitely seek help and advice wether that's with a fellow learner or a facilitator which
        might be helpful depending on the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will seek help by reaching out to the facilitators, fellow learners/friends and also in the resources we are
        provided with such
        as discord because other learners might be having similar issues. Of course first I will make sure I have
        tried to figure it out for myself first and given it out. If I notice that i'm not getting,
        then I will seek help with the facilitators.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I expect from the Facilitation team is their support through out this course. It's a very full course
        so their support is essential. Kindness and honesty also go a long way. If i'm swerving off track
        or am doing wrong, I expect to be held accountable. Just a good vibe and relationship will very important
        to me. Also friendships to also go beyond the course would be nice aswell.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main working schedule for foundations has been running from 9-5 which has been effective for me
        so I plan on keeping at it. All of my plans are made outside of these hours that have beeen designated for
        DevAcademy work. I know that at times I will need to work outside these hours aswell and my schedule is
        flexible to accommodate to this.
