        Identity Values
      </h2>
      <p>
        To keep a long story short. There was a time where I had crashed into someone's parked car while they
        were away from it. I was a lot younger at the time and my first inital thought was to leave the area
        as soon as possible to avoid any one seeing causing me to be liable for what had happened. It was
        completely my fault. This was the first time I felt really conflicted and had to really look at myself
        to decide wether I would stick to my values or completely abandone them. Ultimately I decided to leave
        a note on their windscreen. It was definitely the harder decision at the time but it was the right one.
        I had always been taught be take responsibilty for my personal actions. That it was no one elses
        obligation to up my wrong doings and be harmed by them in anyway. From thas point on I knew that running
        away from my problems was not an option but facing them was the only right thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in a Brazillian and predominantly christian home has definitely influenced my values
        and identity over the years. I would say it mainly taught me to be grateful everyday for everything
        in life. Even just the oportunity to wake up every morning as many people don't have that luxury. It has allowed
        me to keep an eye outfor the little things which at times we take for granted. Everytime I visit Brazil
        I notice how happy and joyful everyone is despite most the people living in less than ideal circumstances.
        That is very much part of our culture and is something I carry with me. My parents are two people that
        influenced me the most and I look up to them still to this day. They are the reason that I value
        self-accountability and being true to your values no matter the circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would say one of my strengths is my ability to again, hold my self accountable when it comes to my
        and commitments I have made with myself. This allows me to make my learning and growth a priority and
        also make sacrifices when I need to. I believe that this strength will be very valuable during this course since
        it is full on and requires all of your dedication and effort. I'm also very much into getting into new
        situations in life, facing new challenges and bulding new skill sets. I get excited when I'm introduced
        to something that is new to me and to picture myself being competent at a new skill in the future is a great
        feeling.
        obviously there is a lot of work and dedication that has is involved in between but I do get an initial
        boost of motivation.

        In terms of limitations I have to say I can feel overwhelmed at times, with big tasks that involve new
        concepts. I have been able to keep this under control by breaking it up into many smaller tasks and
        focusing on each of them at a time. Since most of what we are learning is new to me, it is very
        that I keep this in mind and practise it whenever I can. I hope to improve a alot on this during my learning
        journey with
        DevAcademy. I consider my self somewhat of an introvert and as iv'e gotten older I've grown to prefer it that
        way.
        However, I really want to improve on that as it could stop me from developing relationships and even
        learning from fellow students.

        For one of my University classes we had to complete a group project where we had to use a CAD software
        to execute a cabin design we had made. It was a group and everyone had to complete a section of the cabin and
        end the end we would join everything together to form the cabin on the software. As the due date got closer,
        tension and frustration started to grow within the goup as we all depended on each other to have it completed
        in order to submit the project. Thankfully we had a group chat where I and others voiced our worries about
        missing
        the deadline and we also came into contact with those that were behind and offer to help them complete their
        section.
        I realised how crucial communication in a team is. Even if it's something like frustration, I feel it's
        important to
        communicate as others can be more helpful and understanding as opposed to leaving them in the dark. I feel as if
        should've
        tried creating our own smaller deadlines to ensure good progress was being made and nothing would be left
        to the last minute.
